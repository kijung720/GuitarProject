# Because Everything is a Guitar
This is a final prject for 107E. This project will be using Raspbeery Pi and accelerometer sensor to make a virtual guitar.
There will be two components of the virtual guitar: Guitar head and Peak.
Guitar head will have several buttons including functional buttons and chord buttons. Functional buttons will let the player
choose several different modes of playing. Chord buttons will let the player generate different chords of the guitar.
Peak will be the accelerometer sensor. Player will be able to play the guitar by pressing one of the chord buttons and moving the peak.

##Team Members and Responsibilities
This is a one person project by KiJung Park. I will be doing everything.

##Goal of the Project
Goal of this project is to explore accelerometer sensor and build something fun with Raspberry Pi. 

##Milestone for the T-1 week
There are several things to be done this week.
Biggest goal of this week is to finalize the sensor that I'll be using and to study the function and the usage of the sensor.
I'll probably use digital accelerometer since using analog accelerometer will require the use of extra analog-digital sensor.
Next goal is to have a basic, high level structure of the code. To do so, I will need to learn how to get the signal from
the sensor and to produce at least one guitar sound (probably C chord). I'm planning to use recorded guitar sound instead of generating the sound
with Pi since recorded sounds have much better quality.

Here is a list of things that I need to do:
1 - Finalize sensor. (Probably digial accelerometer, MinlMU-9)
2 - Learn how to communicate with this accelerometer.
3 - Learn how to trigger recorded sound.
4 - Have high level structure of the code.

##Resources needed
Software + alpha: I2C, Recorded guitar sound files
Hardware + alpha: Accelerometer (have it), Buttons, Several things to make the virtual guitar (Haven't thought about the design yet but I can
get the materials on my own).
